## Use
See https://github.com/BernhardWerner/cindy_tools for more details on how exactly to use my animation package. Most importantly, it only works on a webserver. The simplest way to start one is via Python and the terminal command
```
python -m http.server
```
Apart from that, you can edit the HTML files directly in any text editor or IDE you like.
